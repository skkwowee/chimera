    "primary_action": "Switch to AK-47 immediately and find cover behind the wall or pillar",
    "reasoning": "With only 38 HP, any hit will likely be fatal. Dual pistols are inferior for medium-long range duels that are common in connector. The AK provides much better damage output and range",

    "callout": "Call connector clear for now but request backup due to low health - avoid solo duels"
